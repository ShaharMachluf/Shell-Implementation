# Shell-Implementation
In this exercise we were asked to make a kind of commend prompt that supports shell commends with upper case letters, such as PWD, DIR, CHDIR and more (you can see that in the file "main.c").  
The user can also choose if the result of the commends will uppear in the standard output or sent to a tcp server.
